Code Guidelines


Naming Convention: 
- use uppercase letters to indicate a new word after the first word
- examples: "turnSpeed" and "leftMotor"

Comment Convention:
- comment above the line so horizontal scrolling is unnecessary

Spacing Convention:
- leave one line between interior functions/sections
- leave two lines between greater functions/sections like setup and loop
