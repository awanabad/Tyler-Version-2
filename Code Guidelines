Code Guidelines


Naming Convention: 
- use uppercase letters to indicate a new word after the first word
- examples: "turnSpeed" and "leftMotor"


Comment Convention:
- comment above the line  for long lines so horizontal scrolling is unnecessary


Spacing Convention:
- leave one line between interior functions/sections
- leave two lines between greater functions/sections like setup and loop


Other:
- case statement for phases
- when creating an intermediate case, add a 0 
  (intermediate cases between 1 and 2 would be 10, 100, 1000, and so on)
- create functions if possible
