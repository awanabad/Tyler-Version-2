Code Sketch


Sweeping the Room:
- a checker to determine when a wall is being approached and to signal a u-turn
- a boolean flag to alternate the turn direction
- a function to ensure writing to motors based on motor postition to ensure that the robot is traversing a perfectly straight line

Under a Table:
- a checker to determine whether the robot is under a table or not
- stop the robot once it is under a table
- adjust the angle of the robot to be parallel to the lowest bars supporting the table
- zigzag throughout all 3 table sections (while checking for walls or the next table)

Charging:
- a timer to signal that charging is needed (should be lower than 90s to allow time to reach charging station)
- a function to locate the drop-off zone
- keepers of the angle rotated and distance traveled so that they can be reversed when resuming
