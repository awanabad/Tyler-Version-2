Code Sketch


Sweeping the Room:
- a checker to determine when a wall is being approached and to signal a u-turn
- a boolean flag to alternate the turn direction

Charging:
- a timer to signal that charging is needed (should be lower than 90s to allow time to reach charging station)
- a function to locate the drop-off zone
- keepers of the angle rotated and distance traveled so that they can be reversed when resuming
